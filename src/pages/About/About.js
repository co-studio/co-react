              We have been building mobile products since early 2013 when we launched the iOS app Coffee,
              which was featured in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melanie-curtin/the-coolest-networking-ap_b_5730554.html">Huffington Post</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/09/12/new-app-makes-job-hunting-social-experience/0a0GHZxxRjPscJaRmgdc3O/story.html">Boston Globe</a> among other outlets.
              Since then we have built apps such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/lrn-coding-app-2015-7">Lrn</a> that have been featured in hundreds of countries as a Best New App by Apple.
              Today, our mobile apps are used by hundreds of thousands of people.
              <br />
              <br />
              As an extension of our interest in mobile products, we started building political bots during the 2016 election.
              After around 4 months we had amassed over 200M views our content, exclusively promoted by our bots.
              Our political bot work was featured in <a target="_blank" href="https://news.vice.com/story/alt-right-racists-twitter-bot">VICE News</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2017/02/08/facebook-bot-trump-protests-webot">Mashable</a> for our innovations in news tech.
              <br />
              <br />
            Today we continue to pursue our passion for building mobile products and bots at Co Studio.
              We love the challenge of creating chatbots that help businesses and entrepreneurs, and pursue every project with enthusiastic energy!
